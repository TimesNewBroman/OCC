# iOS Theming Stuff
Rehosting this stuff here since I lost access to my Myrepospace account.  Themes are fairly out of date as far as icon names go and probably won't work on iOS 8+ without a little tweaking.

_I'm still trying to figure out how to use github, so if stuff gets moved or deleted, it's probably because I'm reorganizing or trying to test something out._
