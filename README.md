# iOS Theming Stuff
Rehosting this stuff here since I lost access to my Myrepospace account.  Themes are fairly out of date as far as icon names go and probably won't work on iOS 8+ without a little tweaking.

You can download everything all at once by using the download button on the right, but if you want a specific zip, just click on its name and then click "view raw."  It's not an elegant solution but as far as I can tell it's the best option available.

_I'm still trying to figure out how to use github, so if stuff gets moved or deleted, it's probably because I'm reorganizing or trying to test something out._
